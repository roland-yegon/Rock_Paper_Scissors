        <h1>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS DELUXE</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Rock paper scissors deluxe, a game build by Roland to bring fun</p>
        <h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>
        <p>In this game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, you’ll face off against the computer. Choose your move—rock, paper, or scissors—then the computer will randomly select its own. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If both picks match, the round ends in a tie. Try to outsmart the computer and rack up wins!</p>
